# How to download, install and serve Drupal 8

The easiest way to try Drupal 8 in your local machine is by executing the `quick:start` command.

```
drupal quick:start
```
> NOTE: You must execute `drupal init` before in order to copy the `~/.console/chain/quick-start.yml` on your local system.

The `chain` command helps you to automate command execution, allowing you to define an external YAML file containing the definition name, option and arguments of several commands and execute that list based on the sequence defined in the file.

The content of the provided `~/.console/chain/quick-start.yml` file is:
```
# How to use
# quick:start --directory="/path/to/drupal-project/"
# quick:start --directory="/path/to/drupal-project/" --profile="minimal"
# quick:start --repository="acquia/lightning-project:^8.1" --directory="/path/to/drupal-project/" --profile="lightning"
command:
  name: quick:start
  description: 'Download, install and serve a new Drupal project'
vars:
  repository:
    - drupal-composer/drupal-project:8.x-dev
    - acquia/lightning-project
    - acquia/reservoir-project
  profile: standard
commands:
  # Create Drupal project using DrupalComposer
  - command: exec
    arguments:
      bin: composer create-project %{{repository}} %{{directory}} --prefer-dist --no-progress --no-interaction
  # Install Drupal
  - command: exec
    arguments:
      bin: drupal site:install %{{profile}} --root=%{{directory}} --db-type="sqlite" --no-interaction
  # Start PHP built-in server
  - command: exec
    arguments:
      bin: drupal server --root=%{{directory}}ÃŸ
```

The previous configuration will execute several commands, in this case commands that will download and install Drupal using SQLite, and finally start the PHP's built in server, now you only need to open your browser and point it to 127.0.0.1:8088.

You can duplicate or make changes on the provided YAML file, to add commands to download modules `module:download`, install modules `module:install`, import configurations `config:import` and restore your database `database:restore` or any other command provided by DrupalConsole or a custom command by your own module.
